Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)
================================

This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software,
you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the
software.

1.  Definitions

The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution"
have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law. A "contribution" is the
original software, or any additions or changes to the software. A "contributor"
is any person that distributes its contribution under this license. "Licensed
patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its
contribution.

1.  Grant of Rights

    1.  Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the
        license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants
        you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
        reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its
        contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works
        that you create.

    2.  Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the
        license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants
        you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed
        patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or
        otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative
        works of the contribution in the software.

2.  Conditions and Limitations

    1.  No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
        contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.

    2.  If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that
        you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such
        contributor to the software ends automatically.

    3.  If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
        copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present
        in the software.

    4.  If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you
        may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this
        license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the
        software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a
        license that complies with this license.

    5.  The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The
        contributors give no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. You
        may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this
        license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws,
        the contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability,
        fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
