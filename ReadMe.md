Questify Builder
================

 

What is Questify Builder?
-------------------------

Questify Builder is a software application designed to support the process of
assessment development and delivery. It is developed in collaboration with
Cito’s assessment experts and contains modules for:

-   Item and test authoring

-   Item bank management

-   Assessment delivery to multiple platforms (e.g. digital, paper based)

Questify Builder allows you to build tests, regardless of the workflows and
processes in your company. If necessary, each module is extensible through an
API to provide support for specific platform needs.

Cito makes this version of Questify Builder open source available for the
benefit of knowledge sharing, and the intention to deliver added value to
effective education. This version contains two paid components. At the moment 
Cito has no intent to replace these two components with open source components.
In the future the software shall be further adapted to more generic 
standards-based software and an even wider utilisation.
