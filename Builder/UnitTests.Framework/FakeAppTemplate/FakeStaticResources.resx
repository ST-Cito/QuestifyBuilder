    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>&lt;p class="UserSRTitelGroot"&gt;A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="UserSRTitelKlein"&gt;1 The Period&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,&lt;br /&gt;it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the&lt;br /&gt;epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of&lt;br /&gt;Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had&lt;br /&gt;everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct&lt;br /&gt;to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period&lt;br /&gt;was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted&lt;br /&gt;on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree&lt;br /&gt;of comparison only.&lt;br /&gt;There was a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the&lt;br /&gt;throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a&lt;br /&gt;fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than&lt;br /&gt;crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things&lt;br /&gt;in general were settled for ever.&lt;br /&gt;It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive.&lt;br /&gt;Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured&lt;br /&gt;period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-andtwentieth&lt;br /&gt;blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life&lt;br /&gt;Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements&lt;br /&gt;were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster.&lt;br /&gt;Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of&lt;br /&gt;years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last&lt;br /&gt;past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere&lt;br /&gt;messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English&lt;br /&gt;Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America:&lt;br /&gt;which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race&lt;br /&gt;than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the&lt;br /&gt;Cock-lane brood. France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual&lt;br /&gt;than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding&lt;br /&gt;smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with&lt;br /&gt;such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut&lt;br /&gt;off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because&lt;br /&gt;he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession&lt;br /&gt;of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or&lt;br /&gt;sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and&lt;br /&gt;Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,&lt;br /&gt;already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into&lt;br /&gt;boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in&lt;br /&gt;it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of&lt;br /&gt;some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered&lt;br /&gt;from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire,&lt;br /&gt;snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer,&lt;br /&gt;Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that&lt;br /&gt;Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently,&lt;br /&gt;and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread:&lt;br /&gt;the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake,&lt;br /&gt;was to be atheistical and traitorous.&lt;br /&gt;In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to&lt;br /&gt;justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and&lt;br /&gt;highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families&lt;br /&gt;were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their&lt;br /&gt;furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in&lt;br /&gt;the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and&lt;br /&gt;challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of&lt;br /&gt;“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the&lt;br /&gt;mall was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and&lt;br /&gt;then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure&lt;br /&gt;of his ammunition” after which the mall was robbed in peace; that&lt;br /&gt;magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand&lt;br /&gt;and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the&lt;br /&gt;illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols&lt;br /&gt;fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses&lt;br /&gt;in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves&lt;br /&gt;snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court&lt;br /&gt;drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband&lt;br /&gt;goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers&lt;br /&gt;fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much&lt;br /&gt;out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy&lt;br /&gt;and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker&lt;br /&gt;on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in&lt;br /&gt;the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the&lt;br /&gt;door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,&lt;br /&gt;and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy&lt;br /&gt;of sixpence.&lt;br /&gt;All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close&lt;br /&gt;upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.&lt;br /&gt;Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,&lt;br /&gt;those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and&lt;br /&gt;the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a&lt;br /&gt;high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive&lt;br /&gt;conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—the&lt;br /&gt;creatures of this chronicle among the rest—along the roads that lay before&lt;br /&gt;them.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
